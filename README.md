# Orca examples

This repo is a bunch of examples that I use for Orca Security
It is likely to grow over time.

## Examples
Each example shows different things.

### sonar.sh
This is a shell script that shows how to use the Orca API to run Sonar queries using the API from a shell script. This is useful for quickly transferring information from Sonar to the API. 

### sonar.py
This is a python script that shows how to use the Orca API to run Sonar queries. Again, this is useful in that you can use any sonar query to gain information from the API.

### tokenizer.sh
The tokenizer script is a shell script to manage API tokens from the command line. 
This is useful for inspecting tokens and getting information about tokens quickly and easily from the command line.

In order to see how to use the tokenizer, run it from the command line without any arguments.
